# CoffeaElectronic Examples

This project is a container used to store examples and code samples for my technical blog, whose content is in the [wiki section](https://github.com/cjstehno/coffeaelectronica/wiki) of this project.

Each sub-directory here is a separate project of some sort and should have a link pointing to the article it belongs to.
