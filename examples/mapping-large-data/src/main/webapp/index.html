  <p>Displays the direct approach of fetching all data from the server and rendering it on the map.</p>

  <h2><a href="v2.html">V2: Filtering By View</a></h2>
  <p>The data retrieved from the server is limited to only what is contained in the bounding box of the current view.</p>

  <h2><a href="v3.html">V3: Server-side Clustering & Caching</a></h2>
  <p>The data is clustered at lower zoom levels and cached, while at higher zoom levels it is bound by the current view.</p>

  <h2><a href="v4.html">V4: Adds in Client-side Clustering</a></h2>
  <p>Adds client-side clustering to V3.</p>
