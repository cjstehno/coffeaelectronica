Welcome to my personal knowledge base.

This blog has gone through many phases, many iterations and many hosts. It is primarily a storage and dumping ground for my tips, tutorials or other items that I have picked up along the way and want to remember and/or share with others.

I find that as I work with new concepts, technologies and APIs it is easier to solidify my understanding if I do a write up about my experiences with it. It also serves as a good reference for that time, usually years later, when I need that very piece of information and it's always easier to figure out your own work than to go back and dig up external documentation.

Generally, I am pretty open to questions and subject matter requests. If there is ever a topic that you feel I should cover or should cover in more depth, please feel free to send me a suggestion via email.

Happy coding!
