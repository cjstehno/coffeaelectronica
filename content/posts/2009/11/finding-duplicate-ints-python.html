</head><body>I decided to start playing around with <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> a bit and figured I should do what is becoming my personal tradition of implementing the <a href="http://www.coffeaelectronica.com/2008/02/interview-question-find-2-matching-ints.html">Duplicate Int Finding Problem</a> with Python. <br /><a name='more'></a>It's actually a very interesting language and I am surprised that I have not really looked into it sooner. It has a rich set of built-in libraries and tons of extension modules.  The code I came up with is pretty straight-forward:  <br /><br /><pre class="brush:python">def find_dup_int(items):<br />    items.sort()<br />    for i in range(len(items)-1):<br />        if items[i] == items[i+1]:<br />            return items[i]<br />    raise RuntimeError('No duplicate values found!')<br /></pre><br />I need to find a handful of other more interesting problems to try when playing with other languages, since this one seems to look basically the same in each language I have tried.  I will have to spend a little more time with Python, it feels very useful, and as you can see, not very verbose (though not to a fault).</body></html>
