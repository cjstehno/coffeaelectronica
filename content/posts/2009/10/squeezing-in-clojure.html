</head><body>I have decided to try and squeeze in a little <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> before the year ends. A little light reading over lunch.  Clojure is pretty interesting so far. <br /><a name='more'></a>I found this example very interesting (from <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure">Programming Clojure by Stuart Halloway</a>)  <br /><br /><pre class="brush:text">public class StringUtils {<br />    public static boolean isBlank(String str) {<br />        int strLen;<br />        if (str == null || (strLen = str.length()) == 0) {<br />            return true;<br />        }<br />        for (int i = 0; i &lt; strLen; i++) {<br />            if ((Character.isWhitespace(str.charAt(i)) == false)) {<br />                return false;<br />            }<br />        }<br />        return true;<br />    }<br />}</pre><br />The <tt>isBlank()</tt> method checks to see whether a string is blank: either empty or consisting of only whitespace. Here is a similar implementation in Clojure:  <br /><br /><pre class="brush:text">(defn blank? [s] (every? #(Character/isWhitespace %) s))</pre><br />if you know me, you know I like nice tight code... so this makes me happy.   I also decided that since I have spent some time on the Android platform this year, which is very standard, though limited, Java, I figured it would be a nice bit of mental exercise to learn something so completely different. Clojure is a LISP style functional language, which as can be seen from the example above, is a bit of a stretch from Java. The nice thing to note is that Clojure is a JVM-language so it runs on the standard JVM and has access to any/all Java APIs.  I have noticed that I tend to favor JVM-based languages more than others... I guess I like to learn something new without straying too far from the power and flexability that I already have avaiable. I like to keep things practical so that if/when the need arises to use one of the alternate languages that I know, I will be functional with it.</body></html>
