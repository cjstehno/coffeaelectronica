<p>I wrote a little tutorial about <a href="/2005/01/jakarta-commons-collections.html">Transformers</a> a while back
and now I found a nice little use for them today. I needed (and do every now and then) need to
extract the value of one property from every element of a collection. Yes, I could write an iterator loop and pull it
out myself, but that takes more lines of code and is not reusable like this approach... and I love re-usable code. I
needed a list containing the ids (long) of the elements in a collection.</p>

<pre>private static final Transformer tx = new InvokerTransformer("getId",null,null);
public static Long[] getIds(List list){
    Collection coll = CollectionUtils.collect(list,tx);
    return(coll != null ? (Long[])coll.toArray(new Long[0]) : null);
}</pre>

<p>The <code>InvokerTransformer</code> invokes the specified method and returns the result as the result of transformation.
    In this case, I want the result of the <code>getId()</code> method. The <code>CollectionUtils.collect()</code> method
    runs the transformer on each element in the incoming collection and creates a new collection containing the transformed
    results. Short and sweet.</p>
