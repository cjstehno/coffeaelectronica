<p>The other day I ran into something I had never tried to do with <a href="http://springframework.org/">Spring</a>
before; define a bean as an instance of an inner class. I did a little searching through the
Spring docs, but could not find anything about it, negative or positive. So, I just gave it a try. Consider the class:</p>

<pre>public abstract class IService {
    public static class ServiceImpl extends IService {
        // something useful...
    }
}</pre>

<p>which would have a bean definition of:</p>

<pre>&lt;bean id="myService" class="com.some.pkg.IService$ServiceImpl" /&gt;</pre>

<p>where the $ is the separator between the main class and the inner class. This is how its represented in the actual
class file so it makes sense. Nice.</p>
