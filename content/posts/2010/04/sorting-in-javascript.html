Here is a quick little summary of how to do it.<br /><a name='more'></a> You call the sort function of an array with your comparator. A JavaScript comparator is just a function that returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether a is less than b, a is equal to b, or a is greater than b:  <br /><br /><pre class="brush:javascript">myarray.sort(function(a,b){<br />    if(a &lt; b){<br />        return -1;<br />    } else if(a == b){<br />        return 0;<br />    } else { // a &gt; b<br />        return 1;<br />    }<br />});<br /></pre><br />This is just an example, your function can base the comparison on whatever you want, but it needs to return -1,0,1. Say you had a set of custom JavaScript objects that you want sorted by age:  <br /><br /><pre class="brush:javascript">var people = [{name:'Bob',age:21}, {name:'Fred',age:34}, {name:'Dan',age:19}];<br /></pre><br />You could easily sort them using  <br /><br /><pre class="brush:javascript">people.sort(function(a,b){<br />    if(a.age &lt; b.age){<br />        return -1;<br />    } else if(a.age == b.age){<br />        return 0;<br />    } else { // a &gt; b<br />        return 1;<br />    }<br />});<br /></pre><br />Not too hard to do. It's actually very similar to the Java Comparator interface.</body></html>
