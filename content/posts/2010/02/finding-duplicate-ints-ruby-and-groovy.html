<body>I am going back to my old standard playtime function, <a
        href="http://www.coffeaelectronica.com/2008/02/interview-question-find-2-matching-ints.html">finding the
    duplicated integer</a> in a set of integers. <br/><a name='more'></a>I have been playing around a lot more with
Groovy lately and I realized that I had never really done a <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> version of
that little function. <br/><br/>
<pre class="brush:groovy">def findDups( n ){<br/>    n.sort()<br/>    for( i in (1..n.size())){<br/>        if(n[i] == n[i-1]) return n[i]<br/>    }<br/>}<br/></pre>
<br/>In this case, I am allowing null to be the value returned when no duplicate is found. It does seem to be a more
realistic value for Groovy. It's a pretty straight forward function, along the same lines as the other languages. I
thought maybe I could find some really cool feature of Groovy that would make this radically different from the Java
version... nope. It does collapse nicely down to a single line though: <br/><br/>
<pre class="brush:groovy">def findDups( n ){ n.sort(); for( i in (1..n.size()) ) if(n[i] == n[i-1]) return n[i] }<br/></pre>
<br/>If you like that sort of thing. Shortly after, I decided to do a quick little <a
        href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> version as well: <br/><br/>
<pre class="brush:ruby">def findDups( n )<br/>    n.sort!()<br/>    for i in (1..n.size())<br/>        if(n[i] == n[i-1]) then return n[i] end<br/>    end<br/>    return nil<br/>end<br/></pre>
<br/>Nothing exciting in either case, but worth doing for completeness.
