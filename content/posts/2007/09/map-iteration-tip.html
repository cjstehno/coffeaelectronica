<body>Say you have a <tt>Map</tt> and that you need to iterate over its contents and do something with both the key and
the value for each mapping. I have often seen the following code used: <br/>
<pre class="brush:java">Iterator i = map.keySet().iterator();<br/>while(i.hasNext()){<br/>    Object key = i.next();<br/>    Object val = map.get(key);<br/>    // do something with them<br/>}</pre>
While this is correct and generally there is nothing wrong with it, you are doing an extra <tt>get()</tt> call into the
map; however, if you iterate over the entry Set you can remove that extra call: <br/>
<pre class="brush:java">Iterator i = map.entrySet().iterator();<br/>while(i.hasNext()){<br/>    Entry entry = (Entry)i.next();<br/>    Object key = entry.getKey();<br/>    Object val = entry.getValue();<br/>    // do something with them<br/>}</pre>
Also, as a side note, with Java 5 and above you can use the new foreach loop to simplify things even more: <br/>
<pre class="brush:java">for(Entry&lt;object,object&gt; entry : map.entrySet()){<br/>    Object key = entry.getKey();<br/>    Object val = entry.getValue();<br/>    // do something<br/>}<br/></pre>
It's not going to double your processing speed or anything, but it is a little more efficient, especially when you are
iterating over a large map of items.
