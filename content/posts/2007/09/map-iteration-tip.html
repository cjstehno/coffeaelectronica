<p>Say you have a <code>Map</code> and that you need to iterate over its contents and do something with both the key and
the value for each mapping. I have often seen the following code used: </p>

<pre>Iterator i = map.keySet().iterator();
    while(i.hasNext()){
    Object key = i.next();
    Object val = map.get(key);
    // do something with them
}</pre>

<p>While this is correct and generally there is nothing wrong with it, you are doing an extra <code>get()</code> call into the
map; however, if you iterate over the entry Set you can remove that extra call: </p>

<pre>Iterator i = map.entrySet().iterator();
while(i.hasNext()){
    Entry entry = (Entry)i.next();
    Object key = entry.getKey();
    Object val = entry.getValue();
    // do something with them
}</pre>

<p>Also, as a side note, with Java 5 and above you can use the new foreach loop to simplify things even more: </p>

<pre>for(Entry&lt;object,object&gt; entry : map.entrySet()){
    Object key = entry.getKey();
    Object val = entry.getValue();
    // do something
}</pre>

<p>It's not going to double your processing speed or anything, but it is a little more efficient, especially when you are
iterating over a large map of items.</p>
