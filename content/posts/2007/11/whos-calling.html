</head><body>Want to know the class of the object calling the method you are in?<br /><a name='more'></a> <br /><pre class="brush:java">Reflection.getCallerClass(1);</pre><br />It's not recommended because it's a sun-specific class and not in the standard Java API, but it will do the trick. I do not really condone using non-API classes like this unless you really really have to, and even then you should comment it and externalize it so that it can be replaced as necessary with a better implementation at a later time.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>Note:</b> the parameter is how deep into the stack you want to go. </blockquote></body></html>
