</head><body>If you are familiar with the <a href="http://springframework.org/">Spring Framework</a> I am sure that you know how to create a context and fill it with beans using XML (DTD or Schema) or maybe even using properties files (have to try that one sometime), but have you ever tried creating a context programmatically... purely in Java? It's actually not all that difficult, just a little verbose.<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />The context itself is created as the <tt>GenericWebApplicationContext</tt>. Let's consider a scenario in which you have two beans, a Spring MVC <tt>Controller</tt> implementation called <tt>AddressController</tt>, and a service bean, called <tt>AddressService</tt>, such that the service bean must be injected into the controller bean.  First we create the context:  <br /><br /><pre class="brush:java">GenericWebApplicationContext context = new GenericWebApplicationContext();</pre><br />Then we create the service bean and add it to the context:  <br /><br /><pre class="brush:java">RootBeanDefinition addressSvcBean = new RootBeanDefinition(AddressService.class);<br />context.registerBeanDefinition("addressService",addressSvcBean);<br /></pre><br />Not too bad. Now the interesting one, the controller will also need a reference to the service bean.  <br /><br /><pre class="brush:java">RootBeanDefinition addressCtrBean = new RootBeanDefinition(AddressController.class);<br />MutablePropertyValues props = new MutablePropertyValues();<br />props.addPropertyValue("addressService",addressSvcBean);<br />addressCtrBean.setPropertyValues(props);<br />context.registerBeanDefinition("addressController",addressCtrBean);<br /></pre><br />Notice that you pass in the <tt>addressSvcBean</tt> object to the <tt>addressService</tt> property; this is the dependency injection in action. You now have a context with two beans, one of which depends on the other.  <br /><blockquote><b>Note:</b> that an actual controller implementation would probably require more properties to be specified but this is just to show you how it's done.</blockquote>Finally you will need to startup the context:  <br /><br /><pre class="brush:java">context.refresh();<br />context.start();<br /></pre><br />Why would you ever want to do this over one of the less tedious methods? Maybe you just like doing things in code or you need a simple context with a few beans, some of which are mocked, and its just easier to handle in code. If nothing else it's nice to know that it can be done. I guess that it would also be useful if you had some other configuration format that you wanted to support... your "parser" would call/generate this code underneath.</body></html>
