<body>In my over-long running thread about <a
        href="http://www.coffeaelectronica.com/2008/02/interview-question-find-2-matching-ints.html">Finding Matching
    Ints</a> (initial posting), I have have come across another solution from a php developer that I recently
interviewed... in php.<br/><a name='more'></a> <br/>
<pre class="brush:php">function findInts($array){<br/>    $out = Array();<br/>    foreach($array as $num){<br/>        if(array_exist($out,$num){<br/>            return $num;<br/>        }<br/>        array_push($num);<br/>    }<br/>}<br/></pre>
<br/>He also mentioned the pre-sorting approach as well in order to speed things up. I still need to fully validate the
php functions that he mentions, but it seems correct. I also didn't go into the error-case much with him, not really
being a php expert myself.
