</head><body>If you are following along you may have noticed that I have been compiling a long list of solutions to my <a href="http://www.coffeaelectronica.com/2008/02/interview-question-find-2-matching-ints.html">Finding Matching Ints</a> problem. I was talking to one of my co-workers, who is not a developer but used to do some Perl hacking, and he suggested that it could be done with regular expressions.<br /><a name='more'></a> Lo and behold, with the help of another of my more regular-expression-ized co-workers we found this to be true:  <br /><br /><pre class="brush:java">public int findDuplicate(final int[] array){<br />    final Pattern p = Pattern.compile(".*?(\\d+. ).*?\\1.*");<br />    final Matcher m = p.matcher(join(array));<br />    if(m.find()){<br />        return Integer.valueOf(m.group(1).trim());<br />    }<br />    throw new IllegalArgumentException("No match found!");<br />}<br /><br />private String join(final int[] array){<br />    final StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder();<br />    for(final int i : array){<br />        str.append(i).append(" ");<br />    }<br />    return str.toString();<br />}<br /></pre><br />Granted, it's not quite as straight-forward as the other solutions, but it is a very novel approach to solving the problem... leave it to a Perl guy. :-) I wonder what the runtime of this would be?</body></html>
