<body>Yesterday I posted a little <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> script for performing <a
        href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">CruiseControl</a> operations (see <a
        href="http://www.coffeaelectronica.com/2008/02/cruisecontrol-project-operations.html">Cruise Control Project
    Operations</a>); I got to thinking last night that this would also be quite easy to do in <a
        href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>...<br/><a name='more'></a>and it was: <br/><br/>
<pre class="brush:groovy">package cc;<br/>    <br/>class CruiseExec {<br/>    private static cruiseUrl = 'http://builder:8000';<br/>    private static projects = ['nightly-build','releases','site-build']<br/>        <br/>    static void main(args) {<br/>        def operation = null;<br/>        if(args.length == 0 || args[0] == null){<br/>            System.out.println("No operation specified!")<br/>            System.exit(0)<br/>        } else {<br/>            operation = args[0]<br/>        }<br/>    <br/>        if(args.length == 2 &amp;&amp; args[1] != null) projects = [args[1]]<br/>     <br/>        projects.each { project -&gt;<br/>            def url = new URL("${cruiseUrl}/invoke?operation=${operation}&amp;objectname=CruiseControl+Project%3Aname%3D${project}")<br/>            def success = url.getText().contains('Invocation successful')<br/>            System.out.println("${project}.${operation}: ${success}")<br/>        }<br/>    }<br/>} <br/></pre>
<br/>It was very easy, easier than Ruby in fact since I work primarily in Java so I did not have to go looking up odd
syntax questions as I did when writing the Ruby version. It is interesting to note that in this version I took the more
Object oriented approach and wrote a class rather than a naked script. You could pull the meat out of the main method
and make an even shorter script version if you are so inclined. It's always interesting to compare the same
functionality across different languages, so I thought I'd share.<br/><br/>Also, it does perform the exact same
functionality, so you are welcome to use this version as a replacement for the Ruby version.
