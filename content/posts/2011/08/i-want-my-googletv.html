...to be usable.<br/><br/>A few months ago my wife and I purchased a Logitech Revue (Google TV) mainly for my wife,
since she has medical issues that make it difficult for her to use a desktop or laptop computer.<br/><br/>Overall, it's
a great product. It provides a much better interface for watching web video content. You can surf the web with a full
version of Chrome (with flash) and you can run various apps, which soon will be augmented by the Android Market
(supposedly coming this year).<br/><br/><a name='more'></a><br/>The downside comes in when you start finding the holes
in the product. My wife wants to be able to view our photos and then share them on facebook or email them. We have our
photos on a DLNA-enabled NAS so it should be easy. The Media Player app was able to see the server but was never able to
get the content. Unable to find any error information or details we decided to try just putting our photos on PicasaWeb
and then viewing them through the Gallery app.<br/><br/>The Gallery App worked for viewing and it did it quite nicely,
very similar to the Gallery app found on Android phones. The problem we had was that when you try to "share" a photo,
you have only one option, Twitter. My wife is not on Twitter, has no friends on Twitter and does not really want to sign
up. This was my first WTF moment with GoogleTV. The second was when I realized that the depth of the problem. There is
no Facebook app, there is no GMail app, there are very few apps at all. As it stands, it is a very anti-social
product.<br/><br/>Putting that problem aside, I thought well, she could share photos with Facebook via PicasaWeb. Wrong.
PicasaWeb only shares via email.<br/><br/>Okay, Facebook might have a work-around for the problem. We tried to share a
photo from Facebook (web) and they have no "Upload photo via URL" so the best she could do is share a link to the photo
on PicasaWeb.<br/><br/>My wife, who is not a techie, found this all very frustrating and annoying, while I was very
disappointed in Google's release of an unfinished product. These Google TV units have been out for a couple years now,
they really should have better apps and more social interaction available by default. I know that Google keeps stating
that the Android Market will be available soon, but they need to start giving more details before the users give up and
sell the unit.<br/><br/>My wife's other main complaint was that it seems to expect too much from the user; basically, if
she didn't have me she would be lost. There are a few tutorials that she has found, but she had to dig around for
them.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great product and we love it and the entertainment that it has opened up for us, but
there are some really frustrating points that need to be addressed. I will say though, that if the Android Market update
does not address these issues and start polishing up the system, Google TV will be nothing more than a niche product
like its WebTV ancestor, and that would be really sad.
