Most standard users of a shopping site or social networking site have no knowledge of how to properly submit a bug report, which is why as developers we end up with bug submissions like, "the cart doesn't work" or "my bar is gone"... completely useless. It's not really the user's fault, they have never been taught how to file a bug report. So, for techies and non-techies alike, here is a simple tutorial on how to properly submit a bug report.<br /><a name='more'></a> <br /><h2>Where to Submit</h2>You have found an issue or bug with an online application, now the first thing you need to do is figure out how to go about submitting a report to the company and their developers. Unfortunately, a lot of sites fall short on providing this functionality. You want to look for "Contact us", "Help", or "Customer Support". The best thing would be an actual bug submission form, but few user-facing sites have those. So you are probably stuck with email or a text field submission form. Once you have found that, you need to figure out what to submit. A point of note, write up your report in a text editor or word processor beforehand so that you have everything ready. The last thing you want is to spend 30 min typing in their textbox and have your session time out so that you lose it all without actually submitting anything.  <br /><br /><h2>The Summary</h2>Start off the submission with a summary of what you were doing when you found the issue and what you experienced. What part of the site/application were you using? Had you entered any data or performed any actions that may be useful to someone trying to recreate the issue. That is one of the biggest problems while trying to fix issues from users: Developers must be able to recreate the issue you found in order to fix it. This summary should be about a paragraph, but at least a few sentences.  <br /><br /><h2>The Details</h2>Your issue is more likely to be fixed (and the developers will love you) if you provide the following details in your submission <br /><ul><li>Time - what time the problem occurred (giving a state or timezone is also helpful if its a national or global site)</li><li>Browser - what browser and version you were using. The main browsers are Chrome, FireFox, and IE. The version can be found in the About menu of the browser.</li><li>Operating System - what OS and version is your computer running. The main OSes for normal users are Windows and Mac. It's helpful if you know what version it is as well.</li></ul><div><br /></div><h2>Bonus</h2>If you can, try to take a screenshot of the error/problem. You can use the PrintScreen key and an image editor to trim down a nice screen shot. Most likely you won't be able to include a screen shot due to file attachment restrictions. If that is the case, you should try and send a text copy of the error message in the submission. This often gives the developers something to search for in the code.  <br /><br /><h2>Example</h2>So, as an example, say I was shopping on GeekStuff.com and found a problem. I would find their Contact Us page and submit the following information in their textbox.  <br /><br /><pre class="brush:text"><br />Hello, I was shopping on your site today and from the "Geeky T's" list,<br />I clicked on the "Monkey Python" shirt link. When the page opened it was<br />just a white product page surrounded by your menu borders. This happened<br />every time I tried loading the page.<br /><br />I have a screenshot but am unable to submit it through your form. You <br />are welcome to contact me at this email address should you require more <br />information.<br /><br />Time: about 6pm central time<br />Browser: Chrome v9.0.597.98<br />OS: Windows 7 (64-bit)<br /></pre><br />Companies are all about getting product to market and they seldom put in all the required time to fully test their applications. You can help make things better by filing a bug report when you find an issue.</body></html>
