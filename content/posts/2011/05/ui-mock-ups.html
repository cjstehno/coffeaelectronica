I have been doing a lot of UI development at work and during out last release we had a good deal of interface churn. There were a lot of last minute changes, questions about standards, guidelines, and consistency across the whole UI. So, I took up the torch and suggested we start doing mockups for all UIs, with design discussion and approval meetings before development so that we can at least have some level of consensus before moving forward. This sounds like common sense, but you know how it can be... sometimes the obvious can hide out for a long time, and the company I work for is not really a UI-centric company so it has not been as much of a concern.<br /><a name='more'></a><br />Part of the new UI design process is the use of mockups to provide a sketch of the new or modified UI. I did some research and use-testing before I settled on <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> as our mockup tool of choice. There are others available and even some free options; however, none of the others had the depth of features and the wide collection of predefined widget templates that Balsamiq has.<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with doing mock-ups, I suggest you give it a try. You may think that it's a waste of time doing a mock-up in this sketchy form (such as in the image); however, what you gain is a conceptual overview of what your UI is going to look like without causing any confusion as to it only being a mock-up. There is a common problem when doing mock-ups or demos of a UI using more realistic images, or actual UI framework click-through... they can look too real and give viewers the false notion that you are already "most of the way there" which can have you back-pedaling to explain that this is only a mock-up. With the sketchy look, its very clear.<br /><br />Yes, you can also do this kind of work on a white board or paper, but this approach gives you a nice set of tools/widgets to work with and also allows you to easily add the diagrams to other design documents or to store them in version control. What I have been doing at work is putting my mock-ups in my design wiki page and then replacing the mock-up image with a real screenshot of the item once it has been implemented. This approach combined with mock-ups has really made the design process a lot more stable and has helped to highlight issues that we normally wouldn't have run into other than during development.<br /><br />As a side note, I have also found this to be useful in describing UI techniques to other developers without requiring the time to build a whole UI, some of my future blog posts will utilize this.<br /><br />Finally, if you are not doing all that many mock-ups or just want to keep things free, the <a href="http://pencil.evolus.vn/">Pencil Project</a> is a nice tool that I used before moving to Balsamiq.</body></html>
