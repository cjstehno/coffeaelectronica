Welcome to my personal knowledge base.<br/><br/>This blog has gone through many phases, many iterations and many hosts.
It is primarily a storage and dumping ground for my tips, tutorials or other items that I have picked up along the way
and want to remember and/or share with others.<br/><br/>I find that as I work with new concepts, technologies and APIs
it is easier to solidify my understanding if I do a write up about my experiences with it. It also serves as a good
reference for that time, usually years later, when I need that very piece of information and it's always easier to
figure out your own work than to go back and dig up external documentation.<br/><br/>Generally, I am pretty open to
questions and subject matter requests. If there is ever a topic that you feel I should cover or should cover in more
depth, please feel free to send me a suggestion via email.<br/><br/>Happy coding!
