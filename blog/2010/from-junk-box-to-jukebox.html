	<h1>From Junk Box to Jukebox in a Couple Hours</h1>

	<p><em><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"></span> 17 October 2010</em> ~ <a href='/tags/blog.html'><span class='label label-success'><span class='glyphicon glyphicon-tag'></span> blog</span></a></p>

	<p><p>I finally got tired of griping about not having enough space on my phone to store all of my music, and not wanting to<br/>pay for one of the music cloud storage services... so I decided to bite the bullet and setup my own using<br/><a href="http://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Server</a>, <a href="http://subsonic.org/">SubSonic Music Streamer</a> and its<br/>Android app. It only took a couple hours, most of which was baby-sitting installations, and now I am able to listen to<br/>any/all of my music whenever and wherever I want; it's quite nice.</p><p>The steps are pretty straight forward, but going into this process I must make it clear that I am not an expert network/server administrator,<br/>I am a developer, therefore if this process causes you or your equipment any harm in any way, sorry, but it's not my<br/>fault. Continue at your own risk.</p><p>First, you need a computer to work with. I had an old Dell desktop that is about four or five years old and it is working nicely.<br/>Hook up a keyboard, mouse and monitor to the box... if it's an<br/>old desktop box you should have all the connections you need. You will also need to connect the box to your<br/>network.</p><p>It almost goes without saying that you will need internet access of at least DSL, but really I would not do this with<br/>anything less than a high-speed cable internet connection.</p><p>Download <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/server">Ubuntu 10.10 Server</a> (or whatever the most current version is when<br/>you read this). Make sure that you are downloading the server version, <em>not</em> the desktop. Also make sure that you<br/>download the appropriate version for your system, 32- or 64-bit. I had to use 32-bit since it was an old desktop<br/>box.</p><p>Burn the .iso file you downloaded to a CD (I recommend <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/">ImgBurn</a> if<br/>you don't have a favorite image buring application).</p><p>Once you have the CD created, pop it into the box you are<br/>building and boot from it. You may have to fiddle with your boot order in your bios, but the CD is bootable. Once the<br/>Ubuntu installation menu comes up, just follow the instructions.</p><p>A couple items to be aware of: You will want<br/>to enable the automatic security updates so that you don't have to bother with it yourself. Also, you will come to a<br/>server installation screen (after the restart I think)... at this point I selected LAMP server, Tomcat server and<br/>OpenSSH server. The SSH server is required for this, though the others are not; I plan on adding more to this box so I<br/>wanted to have the servers ready to go.</p><p>Once the installation is done, disconnect the keyboard, mouse and<br/>monitor, but leave the box running. You now have a nice clean Linux web server to play with. I recommend giving the new<br/>server box a dedicated IP address on your network so that you don't need to keep track of it. This is gererally very<br/>specific to your router, so I can't really go into it here.</p><p>From your desktop box, laptop, whatever, connect to<br/>the new server using your favorite SSH client (for windows you can use <a href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> or<br/><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty</a>).</p><p>All of my music is on a NAS on my<br/>local network, so I had to create a mount of the music directory on the server box. There is a nice wiki article about<br/>how to do this, <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently">Mount Windows Shares Permanently</a> so<br/>that's easy enough.</p><p>Now download the deb installer file from <a href="http://www.subsonic.org/">SubSonic</a> and follow the installation<br/>instructions. There are also some additional packages they recommend installing. I did. I eventually want to have<br/>SubSonic use the default servers on the box, but this installation method seemed to be the fastest one to get a server<br/>up and running.</p><p>Once you have SubSonic installed you will need to create a directory for your playlists,<br/>"/var/playlists" by default. Now that the server is running, go ahead and login and change the admin password and set<br/>the music and playlist locations. I created a second user to user for myself that did not have admin permissions. Make<br/>sure that you can see a list of your music artists down the left hand side and you are ready to go... at least for<br/>access on your own network.</p><p>In order to have access to SubSonic from the outside world, you need to setup port forwarding on your router to map one<br/>of the external ports to the server and port that your SubSonic instance is running on. Again, this is router-specific,<br/>but <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a> has a good overview in the article "<a href="http://lifehacker.com/127276/geek-to-live--how-to-access-a-home-server-behind-a-routerfirewall">How to Access a Home Server Behind a Router Firewall</a>".</p><p>Once you have access from the outside world, you can<br/>install the Android or iPhone apps for SubSonic and play your music while you are away from home. The Android app is<br/>quite good. I created two profiles, one for home when I can use my local wireless network, and another for access when I<br/>am away from my network... helps to keep the bandwidth down. Using the phone is also a nice way to test out the external<br/>interface. Turn off your wifi antenna and connect via 3G.</p><p>One concern I have about running my own server is<br/>power consumption. The box I am using was a desktop box and not really made to conserve energy. I am looking into ways<br/>of setting up smart power usage, sleeping, etc, but that will come in another posting. For now I am going to test out<br/>the actual power consuption using one of those <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/travelpower/7657/">Killawatt</a> plug-in wattage meters so that I can see<br/>what I am doing to my monthly power bill. One thought I had is that if the power consumption is too high, I might look<br/>into building a really low-power box with an atom processor and solid-state drive or something else really bare bones<br/>and cheap. I have a few other projects in mind for this now that I have a server running, though I don't think I will be<br/>moving my blog hosting there any time soon, but you never know.</p><p>If any of this is too vague, please let me know<br/>and I can add more detail. This is intended for users with minimal Linux, networking, and hardware experience, but<br/>sometimes I take more for granted than I realize.</p><p>Good luck and have fun!</p><h2>Follow-up</h2><p>After about six days for power monitoring, the server used 6.38 kilowatt-hours of power. With a little groovy calculating:</p>
<pre><code class="groovy">def kwh = 6.38, kwhcost = 0.12
def duration /* days */ = (((time(&#39;10/22/2010 06:54&#39;) - time(&#39;10/16/2010 10:10&#39;)) / 1000) / 3600) / 24
def costPerDay = (kwh * kwhcost)/duration
def costPerMonth = costPerDay * 30
def time( d ){ new java.text.SimpleDateFormat(&#39;MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm&#39;).parse( d ).getTime()}
def money( m ){ new java.text.DecimalFormat(&#39;$0.00&#39;).format( m )}
println &quot;${money(costPerDay)}/day ==&gt; ${money(costPerMonth)}/month&quot;
</code></pre><p>I found that the server uses roughly $0.13/day or $3.93/month on average based on the time duration I tested in which<br/>the server was under normal usage. Obviously, this number is very dependent on the system you build your server with.<br/>Given some of the new Atom-based boxes that are available, you could probably really cut that cost down even more. If<br/>you consider that most hosting with any useful functionality is at least $3-5 per month, and a lot of the cloud-based<br/>services that are coming out are in the range of $5-10 per month... $3-5 per month for your own server with unlimited<br/>possibilities is not bad at all. Also there is one cost-cutting measure you can do with your own server that you<br/>cannot do with hosting... turn it off.</p><p>Finally, I also found a useful tool for working with the server. If you<br/>have an Android phone you can install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/">ConnectBot</a> which gives you SSH<br/>shell access to your server. I don't have my SSH port forwarded from the router so this only works inside my home<br/>network via wireless, but ConnectBot makes it very easy to check on the status of the box, do a shutdown or restart the<br/>web server without having to fire up your desktop box.</p></p>
