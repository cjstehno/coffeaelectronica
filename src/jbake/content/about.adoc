Hello, I'm http://stehno.com[Christopher J. Stehno] and welcome to my personal knowledge base (a.k.a. blog). I am just a Java and Groovy developer
with a passion for programming as a hobby and as a career. This blog has gone through many phases, many iterations and many hosts over the years; 
however, it has become a primary storage and dumping ground for my tips, tutorials or other interesting items that I have picked up or learned along 
the way, as much for my memory as for sharing with others.

I find that as I work with new concepts, technologies and APIs it is easier to solidify my understanding if I write something about my experience. It 
also serves as a good reference for later when I need that very piece of information again; it's always easier to figure out your own work than to go 
back and dig up external documentation again.

Generally, I am pretty open to questions and subject matter requests. If there is ever a topic that you feel I should cover or should cover in more 
depth, please feel free to send me a suggestion via https://plus.google.com/+ChristopherStehno[Google&plus;]. You can also find me answering questions
(when I can) over on http://stackoverflow.com/users/135294/cjstehno[StackOverflow.com] or coding on my https://github.com/cjstehno[GitHub projects].
