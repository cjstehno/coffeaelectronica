Welcome to my personal knowledge base. I am just a Java/Groovy/Web developer with a passion for programming as a hobby and as a career. This blog has gone through many phases, many iterations and many hosts over the years. It have become primarily a storage and dumping ground for my tips, tutorials or other items that I have picked up along the way, as much for my memory as for sharing with others.

I find that as I work with new concepts, technologies and APIs it is easier to solidify my understanding if I do a write up about my experiences with it. It also serves as a good reference for that time, usually years later, when I need that very piece of information and it's always easier to figure out your own work than to go back and dig up external documentation.

Generally, I am pretty open to questions and subject matter requests. If there is ever a topic that you feel I should cover or should cover in more depth, please feel free to send me a suggestion via [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+ChristopherStehno). You can also find me answering questions (when I can) over on [StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) ([profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/135294/cjstehno)) or coding on my [GitHub](http://github.com) projects ([profile](https://github.com/cjstehno))

Happy coding!
